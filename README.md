### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ed :) I don't use GitHub that much for my personal work, mainly for archiving old projects and contributing to the projects of others, so why not check out my GitLab: https://gitlab.com/ed_e  

If you want to read about me professionally or want to see a portfolio, see my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-englefield/
